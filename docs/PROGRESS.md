# Receiptor - Development Progress Report

**Project:** Receiptor - Household Grocery Budget Tracking App  
**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025 - 16:50 CET  
**Status:** Foundation Complete, Features NOT Started 🚧

---

## 🚨 REALITY CHECK (October 8, 2025)

### What Actually Works
- ✅ Shared package (75 tests, 80%+ coverage)
- ✅ Database schema (11 tables, 30+ RLS policies)
- ✅ Docker environment (PostgreSQL + Next.js running)
- ✅ Business logic (receipt parsing, categorization, analytics)

### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Authentication (no pages created, leads to 404)
- ❌ All features (receipts, budgets, households - nothing built)
- ❌ Mobile app functionality (UI only, no backend)
- ❌ Web app features (only landing page exists)

### User Experience Right Now
**Can do:** View landing page at http://localhost:3000  
**Cannot do:** Sign up, log in, upload receipts, track budgets, or ANYTHING else

**Progress:** ~12% complete (infrastructure only)  
**Estimate to MVP:** 80-100 hours of development

**See:** `CURRENT_STATUS_REALITY_CHECK.md` for full breakdown
