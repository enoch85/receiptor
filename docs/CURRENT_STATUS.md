## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied Today

### Build System Fixes

**Problem:** EAS Build failing with "Class private methods are not enabled"

**Root Cause:** TanStack Query v5.90 uses modern JavaScript private methods (`#method()`) which require Babel plugins

**Solution Applied:**

1. ✅ Updated `babel.config.js` with required plugins:
   - `@babel/plugin-transform-private-methods`
   - `@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties`
   - `@babel/plugin-transform-private-property-in-object`
2. ✅ Switched to `babel-preset-expo` (standard for Expo projects)
3. ✅ Removed `@types/react-native` (included in react-native package)
4. ✅ Fixed dependency versions with `npx expo install --fix`

**Result:** Expo doctor now passes 16/17 checks (jest version warning only)
