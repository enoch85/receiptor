# üö® CURRENT STATUS - OCTOBER 8, 2025 (16:50 CET)

**CRITICAL REALITY CHECK**

---

## What Actually Works Right Now

### ‚úÖ 100% Functional

1. **Shared Package** (75 tests passing)
   - Receipt parsing logic
   - AI categorization
   - Budget calculations
   - Currency/date formatting
   - All utilities tested

2. **Database Schema** (PostgreSQL)
   - 11 tables created
   - 30+ RLS policies defined
   - Migrations ready
   - Can connect via Docker

3. **Docker Environment**
   - PostgreSQL container running
   - Next.js app on port 3000
   - Hot reload working
   - Simple commands work

---

## What DOESN'T Work (Despite UI Existing)

### ‚ùå Sign Up/Sign In - **COMPLETELY BROKEN**

**Problem:** All auth links lead to 404

**Why:**
- Web app has buttons for "Sign In" and "Sign Up"
- These link to `/login` and `/signup`
- **Those pages DON'T EXIST**
- No auth pages created yet
- Zero backend integration

**Files Missing:**
```
web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx       ‚ùå DOESN'T EXIST
web/src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx      ‚ùå DOESN'T EXIST
web/src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx           ‚ùå DOESN'T EXIST
```

### ‚ùå Mobile App - **UI ONLY, NO FUNCTIONALITY**

**Problem:** Login screen exists but does nothing

**Why:**
- LoginScreen.tsx renders
- Form validates input
- "Sign In" button calls `signIn()` function
- `signIn()` function is EMPTY (not connected to Supabase)
- No actual authentication happens

**Files with No Logic:**
```
mobile/src/hooks/useAuth.ts             ‚ö†Ô∏è  EXISTS but functions are EMPTY
mobile/src/services/supabase.ts         ‚ö†Ô∏è  CONFIGURED but NOT USED
```

### ‚ùå Dashboard - **EMPTY PLACEHOLDER**

**Problem:** DashboardScreen exists but shows nothing

**Why:**
- Screen file exists
- Returns hardcoded text "Dashboard"
- No data fetching
- No UI components
- Not connected to database

---

## Breakdown: What's Real vs What's Fake

### Phase 1-3: ‚úÖ REAL (100% functional)
- Database: **WORKS**
- Business logic: **WORKS** 
- Tests: **PASS**
- Shared package: **FUNCTIONAL**

### Phase 4 (Mobile): üü° 30% REAL (Scaffolding only)
- ‚úÖ Structure exists (11 files created)
- ‚úÖ Navigation works (can switch screens)
- ‚úÖ UI renders (forms display)
- ‚ùå NO backend integration
- ‚ùå NO working features
- ‚ùå Authentication BROKEN
- **Reality: Looks nice, does nothing**

### Phase 5 (Web): üü° 20% REAL (Landing page only)
- ‚úÖ Landing page displays
- ‚úÖ Hot reload works
- ‚ùå All feature links = 404
- ‚ùå NO auth pages
- ‚ùå NO dashboard
- ‚ùå NO features
- **Reality: Can see 1 page, can't do anything**

### Phase 6-8: ‚ùå 0% REAL (Not started)
- Receipts: **NOT BUILT**
- Budgets: **NOT BUILT**
- Households: **NOT BUILT**
- Charts: **NOT BUILT**
- OCR: **NOT BUILT**
- Everything else: **NOT BUILT**

## Honest Timeline to Working App

### Minimum Viable Product (Auth + 1 Feature)

**What:** User can sign up, log in, upload 1 receipt

**Requirements:**
1. Create auth pages (login, signup, password reset)
2. Connect Supabase authentication
3. Create dashboard page
4. Create receipt upload page
5. Create receipt list page
6. Test end-to-end

**Estimate:** 15-20 hours of focused development

---

### Basic Functional App (Auth + Core Features)

**What:** User can manage receipts and track budgets

**Requirements:**
1. All auth flows working
2. Receipt upload/list/detail
3. Budget creation/tracking
4. Basic dashboard with charts
5. Household management
6. Category breakdown

**Estimate:** 40-50 hours of focused development

---

### Production-Ready App (MVP as specified)

**What:** All features from product spec working

**Requirements:**
1. Full authentication + onboarding
2. Receipt management (upload, OCR, edit, delete)
3. Budget management (create, track, alerts)
4. Household management (invite, permissions)
5. Analytics dashboard (charts, insights)
6. Store integrations (OAuth setup)
7. Mobile + Web feature parity
8. Testing + bug fixes
9. Deployment configuration

**Estimate:** 80-100 hours of focused development

---

## What To Do Next

### Option 1: Make Sign Up/Sign In Work (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Goal:** User can actually use the app

**Tasks:**
1. Create `/login` page in web app (1 hour)
2. Create `/signup` page in web app (1 hour)
3. Add Supabase Auth integration (2 hours)
4. Connect mobile useAuth hook (1 hour)
5. Test auth flow (1 hour)

**Time:** 6 hours
**Impact:** App becomes minimally functional

---

### Option 2: Build Simple Dashboard

**Goal:** Show user something after login

**Tasks:**
1. Create dashboard page
2. Add mock receipt data
3. Show simple stats (total spent, receipt count)
4. Basic category chart
5. Connect to real database

**Time:** 4-5 hours
**Impact:** App feels more complete

---

### Option 3: Add Full Supabase Stack to Docker

**Goal:** Enable full backend testing

**Tasks:**
1. Expand docker-compose.yml
2. Add Auth, Storage, Studio, Realtime
3. Configure Kong gateway
4. Add email testing (Inbucket)
5. Test all services

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** Better development experience

---

## Recommendations

**SHORT TERM (This week):**
1. Fix auth pages (web: login/signup) - **2 hours**
2. Connect Supabase authentication - **2 hours**
3. Create basic dashboard - **3 hours**
4. Add full Supabase to Docker - **2 hours**

**TOTAL:** ~9 hours to have a minimally working app

---

**MEDIUM TERM (Next 2 weeks):**
1. Complete mobile auth screens
2. Build receipt upload/list
3. Create budget management
4. Add household features
5. Build analytics dashboard

**TOTAL:** ~40 hours to have core features working

---

**LONG TERM (Month 1):**
1. Full feature implementation
2. Mobile + Web parity
3. Testing & QA
4. OAuth integrations
5. Deployment setup

**TOTAL:** ~80-100 hours to reach production-ready MVP

---

## Bottom Line

**What we have:** Great foundation, solid architecture, working business logic

**What we don't have:** Any user-facing functionality

**What users think:** "Nice landing page, but nothing works"

**What we need:** Stop building scaffolding, start building features

**Priority #1:** Make auth work so users can actually sign up and log in

**Priority #2:** Build one complete feature (receipts) end-to-end

**Priority #3:** Expand from there

---

**Status:** Honest assessment complete. Ready to build real features.

**Next Step:** Your call - what do you want to tackle first?
